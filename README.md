# Gott. Wer bist du?

i dont know how to do it

our problem can be classified as the combination of two VRPs:
1. **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP or CVRPTW)**: The vehicles have limited carrying capacity of the goods that must be delivered.
2. **Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Trips (VRPMT)**: The vehicles can do more than one route.

# Files
1. config.py 
* store benchmark parameters
2. constraint.py
* check *capacity and demand constraints*
3. calculate.py
* calculate *demands* and *distances(cost)*

# TODO
optimizer.py
* add optimizer
